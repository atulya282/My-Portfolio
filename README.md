## A short account of myself


I'm Atulya, an Information Technology 2nd year student at BIT Mesra. I'll turn 20 in the beginning of 2022. My native place is in Bihar but I've been living in Ranchi for the past 15 years, which I think is the most beautiful home to have had.  <br /> 
My hobbies include reading a lot and writing on some days. Experimenting with cooking is an everyday affair that more often than not goes wrong. I like listening to  music.<br />
I began with Computer Science rather reluctantly, but with time I feel like I could enjoy very few things as I enjoy this. I haven't done much yet but I hope to keep working. My interest in data science came with being a part of Society for Data Science at BIT. Now I am also a part of GDSC where I want to learn as much as I can about ML.<br />
